* Introduction
This is a collection of configuration files that I use for my daily driver pc. Maily I use
     - Swayfx for window managment
     - waybar for status bar
     - Kitty terminal
     - zsh
     - emacs for editing

But I also experiment with other wayland window managers and neovim. so you will find additional configs for
     - river window manager
     - hyprland window manager
     - nvim
     - tmux
